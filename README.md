# Air Screen

This repo is setup to keep track of code, 
ideas and the like during the initial development.

This program's goal is to provide aid to visual impairments
through color filters, and screen adjustments. 
It will idealy provide aid to those who have eye strain from computer use or eye floaters.
Theoretically continued use of the application will lead to long term eye strain relief.


Current Features
- Colored section that follows the mouse
- Color overlays on applications and windows
- Screen filtering
- Overlays on select parts of the screen
- A toolbox to control common toggles and settings
- Change the cursor on idle
- And probably other things! Yay!
